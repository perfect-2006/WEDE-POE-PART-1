        <h3>Welcome to Paw Pawl Animal Shelter's home page</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Paw Pals Animal Shelter, where compassion
        meets care. We are a dedicated team committed to rescuing,
        rehabilitating, and rehoming animals in need. At Paw Pals, 
        every paw matters â€” whether it is a playful puppy, a curious kitten,
        or a senior companion looking for a second chance. Our 
        mission is to provide a safe, loving environment for animals
        while helping them find their forever homes. Join us in making
        a difference, one paw at a time.</p>
